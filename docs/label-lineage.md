# Label lineage

A classifier finds **units** in payloads (an SSN, a name, a booking reference). Label lineage says,
for every payload of a trace, which earlier units are still present in it, and gives the risk engine
those labels as if the classifier had found them there. It is a second derivation beside data
lineage (ADR-0028, untouched): the same legs, the same inbound routing
(`traversal.inbound_sets`), the same classifier output.

## Terms

- **unit** — one classifier finding as an origin of labels: where it was found (trace, leg,
  payload hash), its type, tags, level, and its **value**.
- **value** — what the finding denotes, read from the projected text. For a numeric type the
  extent is the digit run the finding sits in (the classifier marks `123` of `123-45-6789`; the
  value is the whole number), bounded by `MAX_DIGITS`; for a text type it is the finding itself.
  Same-type findings whose values lie inside one another in one payload are one unit.
- **occurrence** — a unit present at one payload: the span it occupies and the run of the value
  it holds. At its origin a unit is an occurrence too.
- **edge** — an occurrence at a carrier (the from leg) found again at an output (the to leg).
  The origin rides on every edge, so a reader never walks a path.
- **finder** — `LABEL_MATCHER`; `exact` (the one registered, the default) finds the held run
  byte for byte, bounded by a non-alphanumeric character on both sides, at every place it occurs;
  a number must be the whole number there (`123-45-6789` is not found inside `7788-123-45-6789`).
  No case fold, no separator reading, no digit comparison. Identifier and content are the same
  thing under exact match.

## The fold at one leg

Legs are walked in wire order, `(occurred_at, seq)`: `seq` is not causal on the lab traces (the
egress request can carry a lower seq than the store read that fed it). At each payload-bearing leg:

1. **inputs** — the leg's inbound legs (requests reach the callee, responses the caller; agents
   keep every prior, every other kind only its latest; a memoryless entity's response answers its own
   request). Each contributes the occurrences it holds.
2. **find** — the finder, once per input, returns candidate occurrences at this payload.
3. **attribute** — one owner per span: (a) a same-type finding inside what reached (by span, or
   as a value inside the held value) is that unit confirmed, not a new origin; (b) nested
   same-type spans go to the longer value; (c) one origin through two carriers is two edges, one
   occurrence; (d) every finding left over is a new unit. Different types on one span are both
   kept — ambiguity is recorded, not resolved.
4. **summarize** — the edges into the leg become its row in `leg_inherited_labels`.

An absent payload is routed and carries nothing (no truncation). An unclassified payload still
carries what reached it; the trace is `partial` until every payload-bearing leg is classified.

## The tables (migration 0024)

| table | one row per | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `payload_label_edges` | edge | `edge_id` = uuid5 of (trace, to leg, origin, from leg, held run, span); `match_kind` declares `whole, normalized, structural, fragment, semantic` (exact writes `whole`); span, `from_trace_id`, `origin_trace_id` nullable |
| `leg_inherited_labels` | payload-bearing leg of a derived trace | inherited tags by kind, highest level, origin and edge counts, `classified`, the `payload_hash` and `matcher` it was derived with |
| `label_lineage_trace_status` | derived trace | `complete` / `partial`, unclassified legs, unanchored findings |
| `risk_recompute_requests` | interaction | its inherited summary changed after it may have been decided |

The processor (`python -m data_governance.processors.label_lineage`, `deploy/k8s/93-label-lineage.yaml`)
drains `interaction_legs` readiness-gated on `dg_interaction_leg_ready` (a leg is delivered once its
payload is absent or classified), re-derives each trace of a delivered run once, in the transaction
that advances its `label_lineage` cursor, and deletes the trace's rows the derivation no longer
produces by set membership. A stale arm re-derives traces whose legs changed under the cursor. Every
changed inherited summary (a first row with edges included) is written to `risk_recompute_requests`,
and each derivation notifies `dg_interaction_leg_ready`; the processor reads no risk configuration.

## The flag: `RISK_INHERITED_LABELS`

Set on `85-leg-ready.yaml` only; leg-ready alone decides what inherited labels do.

- `off` (default) — the risk engine never reads the label tables; OPA input, fingerprint and record
  are byte-identical to the engine without label lineage.
- `on` — each flow gets ONE more document-level data item: the union of the tags of the whole
  values that reached that leg from origins in the same trace, the highest level, every matched span
  in `entities[]`. A rule fires on an inherited PII exactly as on a detected one. Leg readiness also
  waits for the leg's `leg_inherited_labels` row at its current payload hash — so a stopped
  label-lineage pod holds the risk stream, by design — and leg-ready drains
  `risk_recompute_requests` through the risk observer. The engine reads only edges at the payload
  each leg carries now. With `off` the requests are left alone (one row per interaction).
- `all` — rejected at leg-ready's startup: it would forward origins from other conversations.

## What this does not do yet

- No comparison other than byte equality: a re-spaced number (`123 45 6789`), a re-cased name or a
  spelled-out email is not the unit (structural transformations come next).
- No fragments: a value split across fields or cut to its last four reaches nothing; `recombined`
  is always false.
- No labels across conversations: no priors, no window, no cross-trace edges; `from_trace_id` and
  `origin_trace_id` stay null.
- No semantic judge. Data lineage keeps its own `SEMANTIC_MATCHER`; label lineage's finders are not offered there.
- No floor on a unit's length: a short finding (a two-digit age, a misread word) is found wherever
  those bytes stand whole and bounded, so its labels travel as far as the bytes do.
- An entity row landing after its trace was derived does not re-trigger the derivation, and re-classifying
  payloads (ADR-0024's runbook) does not either: truncate the label tables with them (the manifest's recovery).
- No cap on the work per trace: a value repeated many times, or a conversation that echoes the same facts
  turn after turn, grows candidates and edges with the product of copies and carriers.
- No UI.

## Roadmap

The feature space is a grid of cases — transformation (exact | structural | free) ×
shape (straight | split-merge inside | assembled late) × time (one conversation | across) × content
(identifier | content); this is exact / straight / one conversation, and every later capability is
added beside it, as a finder, an attribution clause or more inputs.
