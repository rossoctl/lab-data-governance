# Lineage — per-request data lineage from the AuthBridge sidecar

Every HTTP exchange a workload takes part in crosses its pod's network
boundary. A sidecar at that boundary sees all of it — who called whom, over
which protocol, with what outcome, and — if you switch it on — what was said.
Attach the AuthBridge sidecar to a Deployment that is **already running**,
switch on the `lineage-telemetry` plugin, and each exchange becomes **two
OTLP spans**, request and response, sent to any OTLP consumer. The application
is not asked to do anything, and nothing about what it does enters into it.

One thing the boundary cannot see is which inbound request caused which
outbound call. Only code running inside the request can carry that, and it
does so by forwarding two headers, `traceparent` and `tracestate`. So the app image gets one
inert layer — stock OpenTelemetry auto-instrumentation with every exporter
off — that wakes on a single environment variable and forwards the header.
The app's source, command and manifests stay as its owner wrote them.

That is the whole attachment: a ConfigMap and a strategic-merge patch on the
cluster side, an image reference and one variable on the app side. It is
additive, it is reversible with one printed reverse patch, and it is the same
for every workload in the fleet — an agent, a tool, a relay, a service nobody
remembers writing.

> **Until a release carries the plugin, build the sidecar yourself.** The

**Start here:** [RECIPE.md](RECIPE.md) — six steps, expected output, back
out. **Why it works and where it stops:** [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md).

## What you get

Per HTTP exchange, two spans. The request span is named
`{self_id} {protocol} {operation}`, the response span appends ` response`; the
pair is joined by `lineage.exchange.id` (the request span's own id):

| attribute | what it records |
|---|---|
| `lineage.exchange.id` · `lineage.role` | pairs the two spans of one exchange; `request` / `response` |
| `lineage.direction` · `lineage.self.id` · `lineage.peer.host` | `inbound` / `outbound`; this workload's stable id; the other end |
| `lineage.protocol` | `a2a` / `mcp` / `inference` / `http` |
| `lineage.outcome`, `lineage.denied_by` | how the exchange ended |
| `lineage.principal.sub`, `lineage.principal.client` | the caller's identity when a validated token carried one (the generated pipeline runs no `jwt-validation`, so not with the generated ConfigMap) |
| `lineage.parent.source` | `tracestate` — parented on the previous sidecar's stamp; `wire` — on a `traceparent` that arrived without a stamp; `none` — nothing valid arrived, so this hop roots a trace and a `traceparent` is minted for the next |
| `input.value` / `output.value` | with `capture_io: true`: the parsed A2A message, MCP arguments or LLM prompt, cut at `max_payload_bytes` (4096 unless `MAX_PAYLOAD_BYTES` says otherwise) with a visible marker |

The attributes are the plugin's: cortex `authbridge/docs/plugin-catalog.md`
(the `lineage-telemetry` section) lists its knobs, and cortex
`authbridge/docs/lineage-wire-contract.md` the wire format. (Both live in the
cortex repo alongside the plugin — this kit is vendored here, but those
producer-side docs are not; see [ADR-0033](../../docs/adr/0033-dg-sh-vendors-lineage-attach-proxy-default-one-trace.md)
for the vendor/producer split.)

A well-propagated trace has exactly one unstamped hop, at the entry: `wire`
when the caller sent a `traceparent`, `none` when it sent nothing. Every other
unstamped hop marks a pod that did not carry the context through — `none` when
its app sent no `traceparent` at all, `wire` when it forwarded one without the
stamp — and the subtree beneath it is visibly its own trace rather than
silently misattributed. The spans say
what happened on the wire; whatever consumes them decides what it means.

---

## How to attach

The target is a Deployment that already exists. `attach-lineage.sh` generates
exactly two things — the per-app plugin ConfigMap (`EMIT=cm`) and a
strategic-merge patch with the sidecar pieces (`EMIT=patch`, the default) —
and there are two ways to consume them.

### Adopt a live Deployment

```sh
DEPLOY=<deployment> [APP_CONTAINER=<container> APP_IMAGE=docker.io/library/<app>-otel:latest] ./sidecar-patch.sh
```

`sidecar-patch.sh` checks the preconditions (the Deployment exists, the
platform-rendered `envoy-config` ConfigMap is in the namespace, no container
already named `envoy-proxy`/`proxy-init`, no port collision, no volume
already named `envoy-config`/`authbridge-runtime` — volumes merge by name
too, so an existing one would have its source silently repointed — and
`APP_CONTAINER` names a real container), applies the ConfigMap,
patches the Deployment, and waits for the rollout. The patch only *adds* —
lists merge by name, so everything the owner wrote stays as written — except
the app container's `image`, which it replaces when `APP_IMAGE` is given (the
back-out restores the original). To back
out, run the reverse-patch line the script printed — a strategic merge that
`$patch: delete`s exactly what the attach added and restores the app image it
replaced, leaving every later change of the owner's in place — then delete
`authbridge-lineage-config-<name>`. (A `rollout undo` is not a back-out: it
restores a whole earlier pod template, silently taking with it anything the
owner changed since the attach.) The line is reconstructible without
scrollback: `EMIT=undo` with the attach's `NAME`/`NAMESPACE`/`APP_CONTAINER`
plus `RESTORE_IMAGE=<pre-attach ref>` regenerates the patch — not `APP_IMAGE`,
which is the ref to *install* and is refused in undo mode (RECIPE step 5).

Two limits. **The target must not already carry an AuthBridge sidecar** — a
platform-enrolled workload (an `AgentRuntime` CR) has an injected one, also
named `envoy-proxy`, so the script refuses rather than merge into it; see the
namespace route below. **A patch is not durable** — the owner still owns the
Deployment, and a platform-side rewrite (operator reconcile, chart upgrade, UI
redeploy) silently drops the sidecar. Re-run after such a change, or keep the
attachment in the manifests.

### Bring your own manifests

If you own the app's manifests, make lineage part of them instead — the
attachment then survives every re-deploy:

```sh
NAME=my-agent NAMESPACE=my-ns EMIT=cm    ./attach-lineage.sh > lineage-cm.yaml
NAME=my-agent NAMESPACE=my-ns EMIT=patch APP_CONTAINER=agent APP_IMAGE=docker.io/library/my-agent-otel:latest \
  ./attach-lineage.sh > lineage-patch.yaml
```

`NAMESPACE` defaults to `team1` and is written into the generated ConfigMap —
set it to your app's namespace. Omit it and the ConfigMap is stamped
`namespace: team1` while kustomize still places the Deployment in its own
namespace: the patched pod then mounts a ConfigMap that is not there and hangs
in `ContainerCreating`.

```yaml
# kustomization.yaml
resources: [deployment.yaml, service.yaml, lineage-cm.yaml]   # yours untouched, plus the generated cm
patches:
  - path: lineage-patch.yaml
    target: { kind: Deployment, name: my-agent }
```

### The propagation half

Both routes attach **capture**. For *attribution* — outbound hops landing in
the trace of the inbound that caused them — the app must forward
`traceparent`: its own instrumentation, or the shim:

```sh
./build-otel-shim.sh <your-app>:latest    # -> <your-app>-otel:latest, attested, kind-loaded
```

then hand the patch the container to switch on: `APP_CONTAINER=<name>` adds
`LINEAGE_PROPAGATE=1` to that container's env (merged by name — nothing else
in the container changes) and `APP_IMAGE=…-otel:latest` points it at the baked
image. Without `APP_CONTAINER` the app container is not touched at all. The
sidecar is a native initContainer, not a regular one, so the app stays the
pod's sole regular container — `kubectl logs`/`exec` without `-c` keep hitting
it, unchanged.

The `-otel` image must be resolvable the way the base is: the patch swaps
`image` and leaves `imagePullPolicy` alone, so a kind-loaded image needs
`IfNotPresent` and a registry-pulled base needs the `-otel` tag pushed beside
it. A Deployment whose env you cannot touch at all has one lever left, the
image reference: `SELF_ACTIVATE=1 ./build-otel-shim.sh <your-app>:latest` bakes
the switch in (the image argument is required).

### Proxy path: auth-free, transparent egress allowlist (ADR-0033)

`attach-lineage.sh` injects an **envoy** lineage sidecar. Its sibling
`attach-lineage-proxy.sh` injects the DEFAULT **proxy-sidecar** shape instead —
an **auth-free, lineage-only `authbridge-proxy`** (only `lineage-telemetry` + the
parsers; **no** `jwt-validation` / `token-exchange` / mTLS, so it never 401s the
demo's unauthenticated MCP/A2A calls, and needs no SPIRE). This is ADR-0033
Decision 2: a bare no-sidecar entity in a namespace that is *not*
envoy-configured gets a proxy, not an envoy.

Same generator shape as the envoy path — `EMIT=patch` / `EMIT=cm` / `EMIT=undo`,
every input validated, stdout only:

```sh
NAME=research-agent NAMESPACE=travel-advisor EMIT=cm ./attach-lineage-proxy.sh
NAME=research-agent NAMESPACE=travel-advisor EMIT=patch APP_CONTAINER=agent \
  APP_IMAGE=docker.io/library/research-agent-otel:latest \
  SIDECAR_IMAGE=<a v1.7.0 lineage-bearing authbridge tag> ./attach-lineage-proxy.sh
```

Two things differ from the envoy path, both by ADR-0033 design:

- **Transparent egress capture, no relocation.** The app is *not* fronted by a
  reverse proxy and *not* relocated to a back port (the rejected scratch-recipe
  approach); it needs no `HTTP_PROXY`. `proxy-init` runs the vendored
  `init-iptables.sh` in its new **include-only allowlist** mode
  (`OUTBOUND_PORTS_INCLUDE`, default **A2A `8080` + MCP `8000`**): only those
  dports are REDIRECTed into the proxy's transparent outbound listener (`:8082`);
  every other port (Postgres, SMTP, the TLS LLM tunnel) stays **direct**. This is
  the inverse of the envoy path's `OUTBOUND_PORTS_EXCLUDE` denylist and is
  **fail-safe** — a port left off the allowlist is not handed to a proxy that
  would break it. Widen the allowlist with `OUTBOUND_PORTS_INCLUDE=<ports>`; the
  two knobs are mutually exclusive (opposite models).
- **`namespace_file` is mandatory (wire contract v1.7.0 §6).** The
  `lineage-telemetry` producer refuses to start without a `namespace` /
  `namespace_file`, so the generated ConfigMap sets
  `namespace_file: /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/namespace` — the
  pod's projected serviceaccount namespace, the one source that stays correct in
  a config templated or copied across namespaces. A producer image older than
  v1.7.0 rejects a config carrying this key (unknown keys are a boot error), so
  image and config change together — hence `SIDECAR_IMAGE` must be a v1.7.0
  lineage-bearing `authbridge` tag (the published default is refused for the same
  crashloop reason as the envoy path).

The `authbridge-proxy` is a **native sidecar** (an initContainer with
`restartPolicy: Always` + a `startupProbe`, like the envoy path), so `proxy-init`
programs the egress redirect and then the kubelet holds the app container until
the proxy is listening — the demo agents resolve peers at boot with no retry, so
a plain container would race the redirect to `0 peers`. `EMIT=undo` deletes both
initContainers plus the runtime volume and the propagation switch. Needs
Kubernetes ≥ 1.29 (native sidecars); older clusters fail loud.

The proxy path is **egress-only**: `init-iptables.sh` in include mode
deliberately installs **no inbound interception** (redirect mode's inbound
catch-all would REDIRECT every inbound request to the Envoy inbound port `15124`,
which the proxy-sidecar never binds — the app would be unreachable). The app
serves inbound directly on its own port; each hop is still recorded once, on the
**caller's** egress.

> **Known limitation (inherited from redirect mode): IPv4 only.** The
> `OUTBOUND_PORTS_INCLUDE` allowlist is programmed only in the IPv4 `PROXY_OUTPUT`
> chain (redirect mode has no IPv6 branch — only `enforce-redirect` does). On a
> dual-stack pod, an app's IPv6 A2A/MCP egress is not captured. The demo cluster
> is IPv4, so this does not affect it; a dual-stack deployment would need the
> include path mirrored into `ip6tables` first.

### Enrolled workloads: the namespace-ConfigMap route

When the platform injects its own AuthBridge sidecar (an `AgentRuntime` CR),
lineage is enabled for the whole namespace by adding the three parsers +
`lineage-telemetry` to both directions of the operator-rendered
`authbridge-runtime-config` ConfigMap. Leave `self_id` unset — each pod
resolves its identity from the operator-mounted credential. The propagation
half is unchanged, and a platform upgrade re-renders the ConfigMap; re-apply
after one. This route is described here, not exercised: nothing in this kit
generates that edit.

---

## What it costs, per workload

Deploying the app is your work and stays your work. Attaching lineage adds
two commands and no YAML:

| step | command | per | done for you |
|---|---|---|---|
| bake | `./build-otel-shim.sh <image>` | image | interpreter and uid detection, the interlock, the attestation, the kind load |
| attach | `DEPLOY=<name> APP_CONTAINER=<c> APP_IMAGE=…-otel:latest ./sidecar-patch.sh` | Deployment | the ConfigMap, the patch, six preconditions, the rollout wait |

Capture only is one command, the attach without `APP_CONTAINER`. A fleet is
two loops (RECIPE "A fleet"). Then read the *shape* of one trace: one root per
turn, unstamped only at the entry.

---

## Prerequisites and configuration

On the host running the scripts:

- **`kubectl`** (the attach path) and **`kind`** (the bake's image load) on
  `PATH`; a container engine, **podman** or **docker** (`CONTAINER_TOOL`
  selects, nothing else is supported); **`python3`** for the verify step.
- **Network egress at bake time** to `ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv` and PyPI — the
  shim build pulls `uv` and the OpenTelemetry packages. `NO_KIND_LOAD=1` skips
  only the cluster load, not the build, so the bake is not offline-capable;
  the image *probes* run `--network=none`, the build does not.
- **RBAC** in the target namespace: get/patch/watch `deployments` (the rollout
  wait watches) and get/create/patch/delete `configmaps` (a re-attach `apply`s —
  i.e. patches — over an existing ConfigMap); the verify step also needs `create pods` in
  the namespace and `get deployments` + `get pods/log` in `rossoctl-system`.

In the cluster:

- A cluster with the platform installed and the platform-rendered
  **`envoy-config` ConfigMap** in the target namespace (the sidecar mounts it).
- **Kubernetes ≥ 1.29** — the sidecar is attached as a *native sidecar* (an
  `initContainers` entry with `restartPolicy: Always`), on by default since 1.29
  (GA in 1.33). On an older cluster the apiserver rejects the native-sidecar
  fields (`startupProbe: Forbidden: may not be set for init containers without
  restartPolicy=Always`) — loud, on **both** routes: the adopt path at
  `sidecar-patch.sh`'s server-side dry-run, before any write (with a needs-1.29
  hint); the manifests route at your own `kubectl apply` of the Deployment —
  the ConfigMap from that same apply does persist, inert on its own (no pod
  references it), so delete it if you back off.
- Sidecar images resolvable from the cluster: `SIDECAR_IMAGE` /
  `PROXY_INIT_IMAGE`, defaulting to the published
  `ghcr.io/rossoctl/cortex/{authbridge-envoy,proxy-init}:latest` — see the
  caveat at the top.
- An **OTLP/gRPC endpoint**, `OTEL_ENDPOINT`, default
  `otel-collector.rossoctl-system.svc.cluster.local:4317`. Nothing downstream
  is assumed; DESIGN "Where you see the spans" covers the platform collector.
- **Know what leaves the pod.** Content capture is off by default, as in the
  plugin. `CAPTURE_IO=true` makes the spans carry parsed content: LLM prompts,
  MCP arguments, A2A messages, cut at 4,096 bytes (`MAX_PAYLOAD_BYTES`;
  `-1` keeps them whole). That content is
  PII-bearing. It travels to `OTEL_ENDPOINT` as plain gRPC unless the endpoint
  starts with `https://`, and on the stock platform the collector prints every
  attribute into its own pod log.

The generated ConfigMap's plugin entry:

```yaml
- name: lineage-telemetry
  config:
    otel_endpoint: "otel-collector.rossoctl-system.svc.cluster.local:4317"   # host:port; https:// prefix turns on TLS
    capture_io: false     # the plugin's default; CAPTURE_IO=true attaches the parsed content — PII lives in it
    self_id: "<deploy>"   # ALWAYS set (SELF_ID, default: the Deployment name) — see below
    # max_payload_bytes: 4096 — the plugin's default cap on a captured value (MAX_PAYLOAD_BYTES)
```

`self_id` is always emitted: the plugin's `self_id_file` fallback (the
operator-mounted credential, which can race its own Secret and fail the
sidecar's boot) is deliberately never used on a ConfigMap this kit generates.
The plugin's `bypass_paths` / `bypass_hosts` keep infrastructure noise out
(agent-card discovery, health probes, telemetry backends) at their **plugin
defaults** — they are not adjustable from this kit: setting either key
*replaces* the default list rather than extending it, and a hand-edit of the
generated ConfigMap only lasts until the next attach or back-out rewrites it.
`OUTBOUND_PORTS_EXCLUDE` keeps
a port out of the iptables redirect: an app's own telemetry export port, or a
**plaintext non-HTTP store** it talks to (Postgres 5432, SMTP 1025, Redis 6379
— the outbound listener's HTTP codec would close them; DESIGN "What the
sidecar can and cannot see"). Never exclude LLM, tool, peer or S3 ports.
`NO_EMIT=1` keeps the sidecar as a pure proxy — a clean A/B baseline.
Script knobs: `NAME`/`DEPLOY`, `NAMESPACE` (default `team1`), `SELF_ID`, `OTEL_ENDPOINT`,
`CAPTURE_IO`, `MAX_PAYLOAD_BYTES`, `APP_CONTAINER`, `APP_IMAGE`, `OUTBOUND_PORTS_EXCLUDE`, `SIDECAR_IMAGE`,
`PROXY_INIT_IMAGE`, `NO_EMIT`, `EMIT`; each script's header documents its own.
The proxy generator (`attach-lineage-proxy.sh`) replaces `OUTBOUND_PORTS_EXCLUDE`
with `OUTBOUND_PORTS_INCLUDE` (the include-only allowlist, default `8080,8000`)
and always emits `namespace_file`.

## Files

Two moments. The bake happens once per image, on a laptop; the attach once per
Deployment, against the cluster. The only thing that crosses between them is an
image reference.

---

## Troubleshooting

| symptom | cause |
|---|---|
| No spans at all | Wrong `OTEL_ENDPOINT`, or the sidecar image predates the plugin — read the `envoy-proxy` container's log. |
| `envoy-proxy` restarts with `unknown plugin "lineage-telemetry"` | The published image, until a release carries the plugin. Build from this repo (RECIPE step 1); the printed back-out line meanwhile. The patch pulls `IfNotPresent`, so a node that cached an older `:latest` keeps it. |
| Only inbound hops, never outbound | `proxy-init` did not install its iptables rules — its log. |
| Outbound hops fragment (`lineage.parent.source=none` on the pod's outbound hops) | `traceparent` not propagating: the app container lacks `LINEAGE_PROPAGATE=1` (the patch sets it with `APP_CONTAINER`; an operator-owned Deployment needs `SELF_ACTIVATE=1`), or the call runs in a worker thread (the `threading` instrumentor is bundled), or the client library is outside the envelope. Only the entry hop dangling is expected. |
| The app cannot reach its database / mail server after the patch | A plaintext non-HTTP port went through the outbound HTTP codec — `OUTBOUND_PORTS_EXCLUDE` it (envoy path), or (proxy path) confirm it is NOT on the `OUTBOUND_PORTS_INCLUDE` allowlist. |
| `authbridge-proxy` crashloops with a `namespace` / unknown-config error (proxy path) | The `SIDECAR_IMAGE` predates wire contract v1.7.0: either it rejects the required `namespace_file` key (image older than v1.7.0), or it lacks `lineage-telemetry` entirely (cortex #761). Use a v1.7.0 lineage-bearing `authbridge` tag. |
| A proxy-path hop that should be captured never appears (proxy path) | Its port is not on the `OUTBOUND_PORTS_INCLUDE` allowlist (default A2A `8080` + MCP `8000`, everything else DIRECT/fail-safe). Add the port. |
| A non-HTTP port the app *serves* stops answering after the patch | Inbound is redirected too, and there is no inbound exclusion knob; the app cannot be adopted as is (DESIGN "What the sidecar can and cannot see"). Run the printed back-out line. |
| Nothing captured when testing | `kubectl port-forward` reaches the app on loopback and bypasses the sidecar. Drive from inside the cluster. |
| `kind load` fails under podman | `container-runtime.sh` saves + loads an archive for podman v5; `CONTAINER_TOOL` forces a runtime, `KIND_CLUSTER_NAME` the cluster. |
| Sidecar `ImagePullBackOff` | `SIDECAR_IMAGE` / `PROXY_INIT_IMAGE` unresolvable from the cluster. |
| App container `ErrImagePull` after the patch | `APP_IMAGE` unresolvable under the container's own `imagePullPolicy` ("The propagation half"). Run the printed back-out line. |
| Pod stuck `ContainerCreating`, `configmap "envoy-config" not found` | Not a platform-set-up namespace (`sidecar-patch.sh` checks; the manifests route cannot). |
| `sidecar-patch.sh` refuses: "already has a container named …" | The target carries an `envoy-proxy` container or a `proxy-init` init container — enrolled workload, another mesh, or an earlier attach. Namespace route for the first; the printed back-out line for the last. |
| `sidecar-patch.sh` refuses: "already declares containerPort …" | An undeclared sidecar, or the app itself listens on 9090/15123/15124; the latter cannot be adopted. |
| `sidecar-patch.sh` refuses: "already has a volume named …" | The target owns a volume named `envoy-config` or `authbridge-runtime`. Volumes merge by name, so the patch would silently repoint that volume's source under the owner's own mounts; the target cannot be adopted until the owner renames their volume. |
| `sidecar-patch.sh` refuses: "has no container named …" | `APP_CONTAINER` matches nothing; a strategic merge would otherwise *add* a stub container by that name. |
